The 'FAAST CHALLENGE' has been created by the mayor of London after reviewing the success of the boris_bike initiative. This challenge requires the implementation of a tube network where trains consisting of multiple carriages travel between stations carrying a maximum of 40 passengers per carriage. The passengers are required to touch in at a gantry in the station, board the train and travel to the next destination. At the their destination they are required to disembark the train and touch out at the corresponding gantry. The train fare for touching in at a gantry will cost the passengers Â£2.00 each.
